I'm currently working as a Ph.D. student in Information Systems at [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/), University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of [Prof. Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/) and [Prof. Ashish Agarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/ashish1site#h.rmjecyvml6f1). This is a job to pursue impact on both academia and industry. My research interests are mainly on **AI for Business**, exactly, I design deep learning models to solve practical business problems.

Before coming to Austin, I worked as a Software Development Engineer in Alibaba Cloud. I received my M.S. in Management Science and Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2022 and my B.S. in Information Management and Information System from [Wuhan Univeristy](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019. I also hold a minor degree in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/).

If you are interested in my [research](https://sangyx.com/publications/) or [open-source projects](https://sangyx.com/projects/), feel free to contact me.
